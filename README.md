# Pattern
Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects
such as if one object is modified,
its dependent objects are notified automatically.
Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

The decorator dynamic pattern gives an object new possibilities
and is a flexible alternative to subclassing in the area of functionality expansion.
